ACM Interactive Surfaces and Spaces ([ACM ISS 2017](https://iss2017.acm.org/)), formerly known as  the ACM International Conference on Interactive Tabletops and  Surfaces (ITS), welcomes original, high-quality research and industry  contributions that advance the state-of-the-art in the area of  interactive surfaces and spaces (including tabletops, large displays,  mobile, and mini devices). We embrace innovations in a wide variety of  areas including design, software, hardware, understanding of use, and  applications or deployments of interactive surfaces.
